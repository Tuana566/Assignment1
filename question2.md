##Tuana and Kenanâ€™s Answer to Question 2

**Q2**Please assign variables to the individual components of your favourite
gene(e.g promoter, 5' UTR, start codon, exon1, intron, exon2, stop codon, 
3' UTR). Print the entire gene by using the string concatenation operator on
the standard output! Note: Feel free to create a fictional gene sequence by
randomly filling in the components.

**Answer**

promoter = "ATTGCGTTAAGCTATTT"
five_prime_UTR = "TAAAGGCCGTATTGCA"
start_codon = "ATG"
exon1 = "TAAATGGGCGGGC"
intron = "AAGGCGGTTAAGGCTA"
exon2 = "GCTAAATCCGA"
stop_codon = "TAA"
three_prime_UTR = "TATCGCTAAAAAAA"
